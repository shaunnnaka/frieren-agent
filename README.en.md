# Frieren's Grimoire of Useless Spells
### フリーレンの魔法収集庫

[日本語](README.md)

> *Frieren is a 1000-year-old elven mage from the manga/anime "[Frieren: Beyond Journey's End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieren)." Her lifelong hobby is collecting "useless spells" — magic that nobody values, yet holds a beauty of its own.*

**A grimoire collecting obscure, niche, and "useless" AI agents, skills, and tools that nobody pays attention to. "Useless" is the highest compliment.**

| **Uselessness** | ×2 | The higher the better. "Why did you make this?" is the ultimate praise |
| **Craftsmanship** | ×1 | Useless yet polished. That's what matters |
| **Rarity** | ×2 | Uniqueness. Something you won't find even in 1000 years |

## What is this?

The world is full of powerful AI tools. But those are just "common offensive magic" — in 80 years, everyone will use them. Boring.

What I collect are **things nobody notices, yet someone crafted with care**. Use them, and the world becomes just a little more fun.
